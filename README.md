# Random Zones

This repository is a FiveM resource that selects zones randomly from a config on a timer.

## Information
Random Zones is a really simple script that just selects a random zone from a list that can be configured to your likings. There are a few configuration settings that will make your in-game experience better. I also plan on adding more zones in the future. Feel free to edit the script but do not re-upload it.
